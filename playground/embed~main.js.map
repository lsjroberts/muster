Creates a new instance of a [[ifPending]] node, which is a type of a [[NodeDefinition]] used when there's a need\n * to always return a value for a certain node even if the `target` is not resolved (is pending).\n * This node is used by Muster-React to decide whether a certain query is loading. It works in a similar way to the\n * [[ifError]] with a difference that the [[ifError]] provides a fallback for the [[error]], while this\n * node provides a fallback for the [[pending]].\n *\n * The `fallback` can be either a pre-defined [[NodeDefinition]] or a fallback generator. The fallback\n * generator receives a previous value the `target` was resolved to (undefined if this is the\n * first time `target` is being resolved) and is expected to return a [[NodeLike]].\n *\n *\n * @example **Prevent `pending` state**\n * ```ts\n * import muster, { fromPromise, ifPending, ref, value } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const app = muster({\n *   asyncName: fromPromise(() => Promise.resolve('Bob')),\n *   syncName: ifPending(\n *     (previous) => previous || value('Loading...'),\n *     ref('asyncName'),\n *   ),\n * });\n *\n * app.resolve(ref('syncName')).subscribe((name) => {\n *   console.log(name);\n * });\n *\n * // Console output:\n * // Loading...\n * // Bob\n * ```\n * This example shows how to use the [[ifPending]] to synchronously return a name. It makes sure\n * that the `asyncName` node does not block the query.\n */\nexport function ifPending(fallback, target) {\n    return createNodeDefinition(IfPendingNodeType, {\n        fallback,\n

You can configure what\n * should happen in that scenario by providing a fallback node or fallback generator function.\n * The fallback node will simply return that node instead of the [[error]]. The fallback generator\n * allows for more sophisticated error handling.

It wraps the `ref` to `spirits`\n * with an `ifError` to prevent any errors from being returned to the subscriber. It makes sure\n * that the subscriber always receives a value node with array of items.\n *\n *\n * @example **Using a fallback generator**\n * ```js\n * import muster, { computed, error, ifError, ref, set, value, variable } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const app = muster({\n *   age: variable(25),\n *   spirits: computed([ref('age')], (age) => {\n *     if (age < 18) {\n *       return error('Alcohol cannot be sold to people under 18!', { data: 1 });\n *     }\n *     return ['Beer', 'Gin', 'Whisky', 'Wine'];\n *   }),\n * });\n *\n * console.log('Subscribing to spirits');\n * app.resolve(ifError((error) => {\n *   if (error.properties.data === 1) {\n *     // It's safe to handle the error with data === 1\n *     return value([]);\n *   }\n *   // Something else has gone wrong, return that error\n *   return error;\n * }, ref('spirits'))).subscribe((res) => {\n *   console.log(res);\n * });\n *\n * console.log('Changing age to 17')\n * await app.resolve(set('age', 17));\n *\n * // Console output:\n * // Subscribing to spirits\n * // ['Beer', 'Gin', 'Whisky', 'Wine']\n * // Changing age to 17\n * // []\n * ```\n * This example shows how to use a fallback generator to catch only specific types of errors.\n * The fallback generator in this example checks if the error received has data equal to 1.\n * If not, it returns the original error.\n *\n *\n * @example **Catching action errors**\n * ```js\n * import muster, { action, call, error, ifError, ref } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const app = muster({\n *   getGreeting: action((name) => {\n *     if (!/[A-Za-z]+/.test(name)) {\n *       return error(`Invalid name: ${name}`);\n *     }\n *     return `Hello, ${name}`;\n *   }),\n *   getGreetingSafe: ifError('Hello, stranger', ref('getGreeting')),\n * });\n *\n * const bob = await app.resolve(call('getGreeting', ['Bob']));\n * // bob === 'Hello, Bob'\n *\n * const invalid = await app.resolve(call('getGreeting', ['123']));\n * // invalid === 'Invalid name: 123'\n *\n * const bobSafe = await app.resolve(call('getGreetingSafe', ['Bob']));\n * // bobSafe === 'Hello, Bob'\n *\n * const invalidSafe = await app.resolve(call('getGreetingSafe', ['123']));\n * // invalidSafe === 'Hello, stranger'\n * ```\n * This example shows how to use the [[ifError]] to catch action errors and replace the\n * result with a different one. Just like in the previous example, you could use the fallback\n * generator..\n */\nexport function ifError(fallback, target) {\n    return createNodeDefinition(IfErrorNodeType, {\n        fallback: parseFallbackGenerator(fallback),\n        target: isNodeDefinition(target) ? target : value(target),\n    });\n}\nexport function isIfErrorNodeDefinition(value) {\n    return value.type === IfErrorNodeType;\n}\nfunction parseFallbackGenerator(factory) {\n    if (typeof factory === 'function') {\n        return (error, previousValue) => toValue(factory(error, previousValue));\n    }\n    if (isNodeDefinition(factory)) {\n        return () => factory;\n    }\n    const fallback = toValue(factory);\n    return () => fallback;\n}\n//# sourceMappingURL=if-error.js.map","import Observable from './observable';\nexport default function map(iteratee, stream) {\n    // tslint:disable-next-line:ter-prefer-arrow-callback\n    return new Observable(function factory(observer) {\n        let index = -1;\n        // tslint:disable-next-line:ter-prefer-arrow-callback\n        const subscription = stream.subscribe({\n            next(value) {\n                // tslint:disable-next-line:no-increment-decrement no-param-reassign\n                const mappedValue = iteratee(value, ++index);\n                observer.next(mappedValue);\n            },\n            error(error) {\n                observer.error(error);\n            },\n            complete() {\n                observer.complete();\n            },\n        });\n        return function unsubscribe() {\n            subscription.unsubscribe();\n        };\n    });\n}\n//# sourceMappingURL=map.js.map","import { getProxiedNodeValue, } from '../types/graph';\nimport * as graphTypes from './graph-types';\nimport * as hash from './hash';\nexport const nodeType = hash.registerTypeHasher(graphTypes.nodeType, (value) => value.name);\nexport const nodeDefinition = hash.registerTypeHasher(graphTypes.nodeDefinition, (value) => value.id);\nexport const graphNode = hash.registerTypeHasher(graphTypes.graphNode, (value) => value.id);\nconst nodeDependencyShapeHasher = hash.type(graphTypes.nodeDependency);\nexport const nodeDependency = hash.registerTypeHasher(graphTypes.nodeDependency, nodeDependencyShapeHasher);\nexport const context = hash.registerTypeHasher(graphTypes.context, (value) => value.id);\nexport const scope = hash.registerTypeHasher(graphTypes.scope, (value) => value.id);\nexport const operationType = hash.registerTypeHasher(graphTypes.operationType, (value) => value.name);\nexport const graphOperation = hash.registerTypeHasher(graphTypes.graphOperation, (value) => value.id);\nexport const graphAction = hash.registerTypeHasher(graphTypes.graphAction, (value) => value.id);\nexport const event = hash.registerTypeHasher(graphTypes.event, (value) => `${hash.string(value.type)}:${hash.any(value.payload)}`);\nexport const proxiedNode = hash.registerTypeHasher(graphTypes.proxiedNode, (value) => `P(${getProxiedNodeValue(value).id})`);\n//# sourceMappingURL=graph-hash.js.map","import { once } from '../nodes/graph/once';\nimport { resolveOperation } from '../operations/resolve';\nimport { getInvalidTypeErrorMessage } from './get-invalid-type-error';\nexport default function parseNodeDependency(target, options) {\n    return {\n        target: options.once ? once(target) : target,\n        operation: resolveOperation({\n            until: options.until && {\n                predicate: options.until.predicate,\n                errorMessage: options.until.errorMessage || unmetConditionErrorMessage,\n            },\n            allowErrors: Boolean(options.allowErrors),\n            allowPending: Boolean(options.allowPending),\n            acceptNil: Boolean(options.acceptNil),\n        }),\n        allowErrors: Boolean(options.allowErrors),\n        allowPending: Boolean(options.allowPending),\n        invalidate: Boolean(options.invalidate),\n    };\n}\nfunction unmetConditionErrorMessage(node) {\n    return getInvalidTypeErrorMessage('Resolve terminated without meeting condition', {\n        received: node.definition,\n    });\n}\n//# sourceMappingURL=parse-node-dependency.js.map","const stubTrue = function shallow() {\n    return true;\n};\nconst shallow = { predicate: stubTrue, errorMessage: () => '' };\nexport default shallow;\n//# sourceMappingURL=shallow.js.map","import createGraphOperation from '../../../utils/create-graph-operation';\nimport { createOperationType } from '../../../utils/create-operation-type';\nimport supportsOperationType from '../../../utils/supports-operation-type';\n/**\n * An implementation of the [[lengthOperation]].\n * See the [[lengthOperation]] documentation to find out more.\n */\nexport const LengthOperationType = createOperationType('length', {\n    cacheable: false,\n    shape: {},\n});\n/**\n * Creates a new instance of [[lengthOperation]].

the [[container]] and [[simpleContainer]].\n * This matcher informs Muster that a given prop is a tree, and that Muster should get some children from it.\n * The [[tree]] matcher is implicitly created by Muster React when defining props as a nested JS object:\n * ```js\n * import { container } from '@dws/muster-react';\n *\n * container({\n *   graph: {\n *     user: {\n *       firstName: 'Bob',\n *       lastName: 'Smith',\n *     },\n *   },\n *   props: {\n *     user: {\n *       firstName: true,\n *       lastName: true,\n *     },\n *   },\n * });\n * ```\n * is equivalent to:\n * ```js\n * import { container, propTypes, types } from '@dws/muster-react';\n *\n * container({\n *   graph: {\n *     user: {\n *       firstName: 'Bob',\n *       lastName: 'Smith',\n *     },\n *   },\n *

syntax is much shorter, while still expressing the same set of props.\n * The [[tree]] prop can also be nested to access some deeply nested properties:\n * ```js\n * import { container } from '@dws/muster-react';\n *\n * container({\n *   graph: {\n *     applicationData: {\n *       user: {\n *         firstName: 'Bob',\n *         lastName: 'Smith',\n *       },\n *     }\n *   },\n *

The behaviour of isolating scope from events\n * dispatched in the parent scope can be overwritten with the help of the `redispatch` property.\n * See the [[dispatch]] to learn more about event dispatching and how to configure the event\n * re-dispatching.\n *\n * Nodes living in the [[scope]] have no access to the nodes from the parent scope so any\n * dependencies must be injected to the scope as part of the context definition.\n *\n *\n * @example **Simple scope**\n * ```js\n * import muster, { ref, scope } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const app = muster({\n *   nested: scope({\n *     value: 'Hello world',\n *   }),\n * });\n *\n * const result = await app.resolve(ref('nested', 'value'));\n * // result === 'Hello world'\n * ```\n * This example shows how to create a very simple [[scope]] with a single branch containing a\n * `value` leaf.

a type of [[NodeDefinition]] that allows for defining reusable fragments of code\n * which can interact with the graph. The [[action]] on its own is treated as a data-node - just\n * like a [value](_nodes_graph_value_.html#value) or an [[array]]. It can be used as a target for a [[call]] or\n * [[apply]] nodes. See the [[call]] and [[apply]] documentation to learn more about invoking actions.\n *\n * The [[action]] can return three types of values:\n * - `void`/`undefined`: for very simple actions that don't interact with the graph\n * - A [[NodeDefinition]]: an output of the [[action]]. This node can be resolved later.\n * - An iterator of GraphNodes: the most common use for the [[action]]. The [[action]] body can be\n *   defined as a generator function. This way the [[action]] can perform complex\n *   operations. See the \"**Using generators in an action node**\" example to learn more.\n *\n * The [[action]] node can be thought of as a [[computed]] node with few differences. The\n * [[computed]] must statically declare its dependencies. [[action]]s, however,\n * declare only a number of arguments, without linking them to [[NodeDefinition]]s. These\n * arguments will be passed to the action at the time of calling or applying. Another difference is\n * that the [[computed]] must always resolve to a single [[NodeDefinition]], whereas the\n * [[action]] has no such limitations.\n *\n * @example **Simple actions**\n * ```ts\n * import muster, { action, call } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const app = muster({\n *   logWhenCalled: action(() => {\n *     console.log('Action has been called');\n *   }),\n * });\n *\n * console.log('Calling action');\n * const output = await app.resolve(call('logWhenCalled'));\n * // output === undefined\n *\n * // Console output:\n * // Calling action\n * // Action has been called\n * ```\n * This example demonstrates how to define a simple action that does something when called with the\n * help of a [[call]] node. See the [[call]] documentation to learn more about calling\n * actions. Note that the function returns `value(undefined)`.\n *\n *\n * @example **Actions with arguments**\n * ```ts\n * import muster, { action, call } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const app = muster({\n *   logFullName: action((firstName, lastName) => {\n *     console.log(`Hello, ${firstName} ${lastName}!`);\n *   }),\n * });\n *\n * console.log('Calling action');\n * const output = await app.resolve(call('logFullName', ['Bob', 'Builder']));\n * // output === undefined\n *\n * // Console output:\n * // Calling action\n * // Hello, Bob Builder!\n * ```\n * The [[action]] node can also define a number of arguments. These arguments will be supplied from\n * the calling [[call]] or [[apply]] nodes. As in the previous example, the function returns\n * `undefined`.\n *\n * Much like the [[computed]] node, the parameters of the [[action]] are first resolved to their\n * most basic form (here with the help of a [[resolve]] node). Resolved values that are\n * a [value](_nodes_graph_value_.html#value), a [[tree]] or an [[array]] are run through the [[valueOf]] helper.\n * This simplifies the implementation of your actions by not forcing you to deal with\n * [[NodeDefinition]]s inside the action's function body.\n *\n *\n * @example **Returning a value from an action**\n * ```ts\n * import muster, { action, call } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const app = muster({\n *   getFullName: action((firstName, lastName) => `${firstName} ${lastName}`),\n * });\n *\n * console.log('Calling action');\n * const fullName = await app.resolve(call('getFullName', ['Rosalind', 'Franklin']));\n * // fullName === 'Rosalind Franklin'\n *\n * console.log(fullName);\n *\n * // Console output:\n * // Calling action\n * // Rosalind Franklin\n * ```\n * This example shows how to return values from an [[action]]. As with the [[computed]],\n * the value returned from the action function is converted to a [value](_nodes_graph_value_.html#value) if is not already\n * a [[NodeDefinition]].\n *\n *\n * @example **Returning a computed node from an action**\n * ```ts\n * import muster, { action, call, computed, value } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const app = muster({\n *   getGreeting: action((firstName, lastName) =>\n *     computed([value(`${firstName} ${lastName}`)], (fullName) => `Hello, ${fullName}`),\n *   ),\n * });\n *\n * console.log('Getting a greeting');\n * const greeting = await app.resolve(call('getGreeting', ['Rosalind', 'Franklin']));\n * // greeting === 'Hello, Rosalind Franklin'\n *\n * console.log(greeting);\n *\n * // Console output:\n * // Getting a greeting\n * // Hello, Rosalind Franklin\n * ```\n * The return node type of an [[action]] is not limited to a [value](_nodes_graph_value_.html#value). The action can\n * return any type of a [[NodeDefinition]]. This example demonstrates the action returning a\n * [[computed]] that resolves to a greeting.\n *\n *\n * @example **Using generators in action nodes**\n * ```ts\n * import muster, { action, call, ref } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const app = muster({\n *   greeting: 'Hello',\n *   getGreeting: action(function*(name) {\n *     const greeting = yield ref('greeting');\n *     return `${greeting}, ${name}`;\n *   }),\n * });\n *\n * console.log('Getting a greeting');\n * const greeting = await app.resolve(call('getGreeting', ['Rosalind']));\n * // greeting === 'Hello, Rosalind'\n *\n * console.log(greeting);\n *\n * // Console output:\n * // Getting a greeting\n * // Hello, Rosalind\n * ```\n * This example shows the use of generator functions as the body of an [[action]].\n * Generators offer greater flexibility than a simple [[computed]]. They allow\n * writing code which seem to be executed in series, but may in fact be making asynchronous\n * requests to external APIs or remote instances of Muster.\n *\n * Note the use of a `yield` keyword inside of the generator function. Yielding a [[NodeDefinition]]\n * instructs Muster to resolve a given node to its most basic form (just like with the parameters).\n * In this example, the ref resolves to a [value](_nodes_graph_value_.html#value), which gets un-wrapped into a more basic\n * representation (with the help of a [[valueOf]] helper) and assigned to the `greeting`\n * variable. Muster actions also allow for returning an array of [[NodeDefinition]]s (e.g. [ref](_utils_ref_.html#ref)).\n * See the \"**Yielding multiple graph nodes**\" example to learn more.\n *\n *\n * @example **Yielding multiple graph nodes**\n * ```js\n * import muster, { action, call, ref } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const app = muster({\n *   firstName: 'Rosalind',\n *   lastName: 'Franklin',\n *   getFullName: action(function*() {\n *     const [firstName, lastName] = yield [\n *       ref('firstName'),\n *       ref('lastName'),\n *     ];\n *     return `${firstName} ${lastName}`;\n *   }),\n * });\n *\n * console.log('Getting a full name');\n * const fullName = await app.resolve(call('getFullName'));\n * // fullName = 'Rosalind Franklin';\n *\n * console.log(fullName);\n * ```\n * This example shows how to yield multiple [[NodeDefinition]]s. Muster tries to resolve both of these\n * values simultaneously before returning the result. The result of such operation is an array of\n * un-wrapped [[NodeDefinition]]s.\n *\n * One major benefit of this kind of batching is most visible when making requests to a remote\n * Muster instance. Normally the `yield` keyword waits for the non-pending result to be returned.\n * In a situation where the application needs to load two separate branches that come from a server,\n * it's best to batch them into a single request. By `yielding` an array we're letting Muster know\n * that these branches can be resolved simultaneously.\n * See the [[proxy]] and [[remote]] documentation for more information.\n *\n *\n * @example **Yielding named nodes**\n * ```js\n * import muster, { action, call, ref } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const app = muster({\n *   firstName: 'Rosalind',\n *   lastName: 'Franklin',\n *   getFullName: action(function*() {\n *     const { first, last } = yield {\n *       first: ref('firstName'),\n *       last: ref('lastName'),\n *     };\n *     return `${first} ${last}`;\n *   }),\n * });\n *\n * console.log('Getting a full name');\n * const fullName = await app.resolve(call('getFullName'));\n * // fullName = 'Rosalind Franklin';\n *\n * console.log(fullName);\n * ```\n * This example shows how to yield multiple [[NodeDefinition]]s as named nodes. The benefit of using\n * this form of yielding when compared to the previous example is that it's less prone to errors.\n * When yielding an array it is possible to accidentally do\n * `const [last, first] = yield [ref('firstName'), ref('lastName')];`\n * This code would work perfectly fine, but the values would end up in incorrectly named variables.\n * The ability to yield named nodes mitigates this category of errors.\n *\n *\n * @example **Create an [[action]] with named args**\n * ```js\n * import muster, { action, call } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const app = muster({\n *   greet: action(({ name }) => `Hello, ${name}!`),\n * });\n *\n * await app.resolve(call('greet', { name: 'Bob' }));\n * // === 'Hello, Bob!'\n * ```\n * This example shows how to create and call an [[action]] node with named arguments.\n */\nexport function action(body) {\n    return createNodeDefinition(ActionNodeType, {\n        body,\n    });\n}\nexport function isActionNodeDefinition(value) {\n    return value.type === ActionNodeType;\n}\nfunction isGenerator(input) {\n    return Boolean(input) && typeof input === 'object' && typeof input.next === 'function';\n}\nconst NODE_MAP_MATCHER = types.objectOf(types.oneOfType([graphTypes.nodeDefinition, graphTypes.proxiedNode]));\nfunction handleStep(generator, { done, value: yielded }) {\n    if (done) {\n        return isProxiedNode(yielded) ?

an instance of a [[query]] node, which is a node used to request values from multiple [[NodeDefinition]]s at a time.\n * This node is used internally by Muster-React when creating bindings between components and the graph.\n * See Muster-React for more information.\n *\n * By default, the [[query]] waits for every field to resolve to a non-dynamic node.\n * This behaviour can be modified through the use of the [[isPending]] and the [[defer]].\n *\n * A [[query]] resolves into a [[tree]], an [[array]] or a [[value]] (depending on\n * the type of the query made). These can be easily converted into plain JS objects\n * with the [[valueOf]] helper. This conversion is reversible through the use of\n * [[toNode]] helper.\n *\n *\n * @example **Basic query**\n * ```js\n * import muster, { key, query, root, valueOf } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const app = muster({\n *   firstName: 'Rosalind',\n *   lastName: 'Franklin',\n *   dateOfBirth: 1948,\n * });\n *\n * const user = await app.resolve(query(root(), {\n *   userFirstName: key('firstName'),\n *   lastName: key('lastName'),\n * }));\n * // user = {\n * //   userFirstName: 'Rosalind',\n * //   lastName: 'Franklin',\n * // }\n * ```\n * This example shows how to use a [[query]] to request two [[NodeDefinition]] at the same\n * time. The `query` call consists of: the first argument which defines the graph starting point from which\n * query should begin the traversal; and the second argument, an object (implicitly cast to a [[fields]]) which\n * defines a map of fields to retrieve from the graph. The name of each property in that map\n * corresponds to the name in the output [[tree]]. Note that this name does not have to be the same\n * as the name in the [[key]] on the right of that property. Take the `firstName` graph node\n * and its corresponding `userFirstName` name in the query. The ability to override the name of a\n * node is useful especially when a given [[NodeDefinition]] can be accessed in more than one way.\n * This behaviour is used extensively by the [[proxy]], and by extension the [[remote]], when\n * building a query to a remote node.\n *\n * The [[key]] used in this query defines the name of a given node in the graph. Additionally, the\n * [[key]] can define a map of child nodes to retrieve from that node. See the \"**Getting values of\n * nested nodes**\" example for more information.\n *\n * A [[query]] resolves into a combination of [[tree]]s, [[array]]s and [[value]]s.\n * This means an output of one query can be used as an input for another [[NodeDefinition]] and even\n * another [[query]].\n *\n *\n * @example **Getting async values**\n * ```js\n * import muster, { fromPromise, key, query, root } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * let resolvePromise1;\n * const app = muster({\n *   name: 'sync name',\n *   asyncName: fromPromise(() =>\n *     new Promise((res) => resolvePromise1 = res)\n *       .then(() => 'async name'),\n *   ),\n * });\n *\n * console.log('Making the query');\n * app.resolve(query(root(), {\n *   name: key('name'),\n *   asyncName: key('asyncName'),\n * })).subscribe((res) => {\n *   console.log(res);\n * });\n *\n * console.log('Resolving the promise');\n * resolvePromise1();\n *\n * // Console output:\n * // Making the query\n * // Resolving the promise\n * // {\n * //   name: 'sync name',\n * //   asyncName: 'async name',\n * // }\n * ```\n * The [[query]] by default waits for every part of the query to resolve to a non-pending and\n * non-dynamic value. This example demonstrates this behaviour with the help of [[fromPromise]].\n * Note that the query output gets logged only once - after the promise is resolved. Muster can\n * also mark certain parts of the query with [[defer]]s. This instructs Muster\n * to return the query result even if that part of the query is loading. See the \"**Defer part of the\n * query**\" example for more information.\n *\n *\n * @example **Getting values of nested nodes**\n * ```js\n * import muster, { key, query, root } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const app = muster({\n *   user: {\n *     firstName: 'Rosalind',\n *     lastName: 'Franklin',\n *   },\n * });\n *\n * const user = await app.resolve(query(root(), {\n *   user: key('user', {\n *     firstName: key('firstName'),\n *   }),\n * }));\n * // user = {\n * //   user: {\n * //     firstName: 'Rosalind',\n * //   },\n * // }\n * ```\n * The [[query]] can extract values from nested [[NodeDefinition]]s. As shown\n * in the previous example, the [[query]] factory function performs an implicit conversion to a\n * [[fields]]. This saves developers from having to explicitly write unnecessarily verbose code.\n * The same functionality is available in the [[key]]. When the factory is\n * called with a pure JS object, it will recursively cast it to a [[fields]].\n *\n * Sometimes, the second argument to the [[key]] won't be a pure JS object. For\n * example, when a developer wants to get items from a collection. [[fields]] lets the\n * query know that a target [[NodeDefinition]] is expected to be a container-like node. This assumption\n * breaks apart when requesting a collection. To request items from collections, one has to make a\n * query with an [[entries]] instead of a [[fields]]. See the \"**Getting atomic items from a\n * collection**\" example to find out more.\n *\n *\n * @example **Getting atomic items from a collection**\n * ```js\n * import muster, { entries, key, query, root } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const app = muster({\n *   numbers: [1, 2, 3, 4],\n * });\n *\n * const numbers = await app.resolve(query(root(), {\n *   numbers: key('numbers', entries()),\n * }));\n * // numbers = {\n * //   numbers: [1, 2, 3, 4],\n * // }\n * ```\n * An [[entries]] can be provided instead of a [[fields]] to instruct the [[query]] to retrieve\n * all items from a given graph node. In this example, we had it easy: every item is an atomic\n * value. The fun with [[query]]s and collections does not end here. See the \"**Getting specific\n * fields from items**\" example to learn more about selecting certain fields from items.\n *\n *\n * @example **Getting specific fields from items**\n * ```js\n * import muster, { entries, key, query, ref } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const app = muster({\n *   books: [\n *     { name: 'The Expeditionary Force', author: 'Craig Alanson' },\n *     { name: 'Fear The Sky', author: 'Stephen Moss' },\n *     { name: 'After It Happened', author: 'Devon Ford' },\n *   ],\n * });\n *\n * const bookNames = await app.resolve(query(ref('books'), entries({\n *   name: key('name'),\n * })));\n * // bookNames = [\n * //   { name: 'The Expeditionary Force' },\n * //   { name: 'Fear The Sky' },\n * //   { name: 'After It Happened' },\n * // ]\n * ```\n * In this example, apart from getting just a selected field from each item in the collection, we\n * demonstrated another feature of the [[query]]: changing its starting point.\n * In all previous examples, we've used a [[root]] as the starting point of the query, but this time\n * to make the output shorter we've changed it to a `books` collection.\n *\n *\n * @example **Creating setters**\n * ```js\n * import muster, {\n *   createSetter,\n *   key,\n *   query,\n *   root,\n *   variable,\n * } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const app = muster({\n *   name: variable('initial'),\n * });\n *\n * console.log('Making a query for `name`');\n * app.resolve(query(root(), { name: key('name') })).subscribe((result) => {\n *   console.log(result);\n * });\n *\n * console.log('Making a query for setter function');\n * const result = await app.resolve(query(root(), {\n *   setName: createSetter('name'),\n * }));\n *\n * console.log('Calling a setter');\n * result.setName('updated');\n *\n * // Console output:\n * // Making a query for `name`\n * // initial\n * // Making a query for setter function\n * // Calling a setter\n * // updated\n * ```\n * This example shows how a [[query]] can be used when there's a need for imperative call\n * to a set method. This setter function can be used, for example,\n * when integrating with view frameworks such as React, Vue etc.\n * Muster-React uses this way of creating setters extensively. Similarly, there's a\n * [[createCaller]] node which allows for imperative calls to actions.\n *\n * [[createSetter]]s and [[createCaller]]s should be used only when the output of the query\n * is used outside the \"Muster world\". Inside Muster code, using [[call]]s\n * [[apply]]s and [[set]]s is recommended for these kinds of actions.\n *\n *\n * @example **Defer part of a query**\n * ```js\n * import muster, { defer, fromPromise, key, query, root } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * let resolvePromise2;\n * const app = muster({\n *   name: 'sync name',\n *   asyncName: fromPromise(() =>\n *     new Promise((res) => resolvePromise2 = res)\n *       .then(() => 'async name'),\n *   ),\n * });\n *\n * console.log('Requesting the query');\n * app.resolve(query(root(), {\n *   name: key('name'),\n *   asyncName: defer('asyncName'),\n * })).subscribe((res) => {\n *   console.log(res);\n * });\n *\n * console.log('Resolving the promise');\n * resolvePromise2();\n *\n * // Console output:\n * // Requesting the query\n * // {\n * //   name: 'sync name',\n * //   asyncName: null,\n * // }\n * // Resolving the promise\n * // {\n * //   name: 'sync name',\n * //   asyncName: 'async name',\n * // }\n * ```\n * This example demonstrates how to instruct a [[query]] to return the output of its query\n * even if a given [[NodeDefinition]] is in a pending state. The query is built with a\n * [[defer]]. This example uses a shorthand syntax for the `defer(...)` node.\n * Internally, the node converts the argument to a [[key]]:\n * ```js\n * import { defer, key } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * defer('asyncName');\n * // is equivalent to\n * defer(key('name'));\n * ```\n * The [[defer]] also enables the defer part of the query to return a previously loaded\n * (stale) value of the target node. See the \"**Defer with previous value**\" example for more\n * information.\n *\n *\n * @example **Check if defer part of the query is loading**\n * ```js\n * import muster, {\n *   defer,\n *   fromPromise,\n *   isPending,\n *   key,\n *   query,\n *   root,\n * } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * let resolvePromise3;\n * const app = muster({\n *   name: 'sync name',\n *   asyncName: fromPromise(() =>\n *     new Promise((res) => resolvePromise3 = res)\n *       .then(() => 'async name'),\n *   ),\n * });\n *\n * console.log('Requesting the query');\n * app.resolve(query(root(), {\n *   name: key('name'),\n *   asyncName: defer('asyncName'),\n *   isLoadingAsyncName: isPending('asyncName'),\n * })).subscribe((res) => {\n *   console.log(res);\n * });\n *\n * console.log('Resolving the promise');\n * resolvePromise3();\n *\n * // Console output:\n * // Requesting the query\n * // {\n * //   name: 'sync name',\n * //   asyncName: null,\n * //   isLoadingAsyncName: true,\n * // }\n * // Resolving the promise\n * // {\n * //   name: 'sync name',\n * //   asyncName: 'async name',\n * //   isLoadingAsyncName: false,\n * // }\n * ```\n * This example presents the use of the [[isPending]]. When used in a query, this node checks if\n * a part of the query is currently loading. Similarly to the [[defer]],\n * the [[isPending]] factory function implicitly converts its argument to a [[key]].\n * ```js\n * import { isPending, key } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * isPending('asyncName');\n * // is equivalent to\n * isPending(key('asyncName'))\n * ```\n */\nexport function query(root, keys) {\n    return createNodeDefinition(QueryNodeType, {\n        keys:

Note that the `peopleWithFullNames`\n * node uses a [[map]] with a [[computed]] node, which can't be serialised and sent over to the remote instance of muster.\n * For this reason we have to wrap the remote collection in a [[fetchItems]] node.\n */\nexport function fetchItems(target) {\n    return createNodeDefinition(FetchItemsNodeType, { target });\n}\nexport function isFetchItemsNodeDefinition(fetchItems) {\n    return fetchItems.type === FetchItemsNodeType;\n}\nconst untilPlaceholderOrItems = {\n    predicate(node) {\n        return (PlaceholderNodeType.is(node) ||\n            ArrayNodeType.is(node) ||\n            NodeListNodeType.is(node) ||\n            NilNodeType.is(node));\n    },\n};\nconst untilSupportsGetItemOperation = {\n    predicate: supportsGetItemsOperation,\n    errorMessage(node) {\n        return getInvalidTypeErrorMessage('Target node does not support getItems operation.', {\n            received: node.definition,\n        });\n    },\n};\nfunction applyTransforms(target, transforms) {\n    if (transforms.length === 0) {\n        if (PlaceholderNodeType.is(target.definition.properties.items[0])) {\n            return target.definition.properties.items[0];\n        }\n        return target;\n    }\n    const transform = isGraphNode(transforms[0])\n        ? transforms[0]\n        : withScopeFrom(target, transforms[0]);\n    return withScopeFrom(target, resolve([createGraphAction(transform, transformItems(target.definition.properties.items))], ([result]) => {\n        return withScopeFrom(result, resolve([{ target: result.definition }], ([transformedItems]) => {\n            const nextTarget = transformedItems.definition.properties.items.length > 0 ? transformedItems : target;\n            return applyTransforms(nextTarget, transforms.slice(1));\n        }));\n    }));\n}\n//# sourceMappingURL=fetch-items.js.map","import flatMap from 'lodash/flatMap';\nimport fromPairs from 'lodash/fromPairs';\nimport isPlainObject from 'lodash/isPlainObject';\nimport mapValues from 'lodash/mapValues';\nimport { array } from '../nodes/collection/array';\nimport { isNodeListNodeDefinition } from '../nodes/collection/node-list';\nimport { isGraphAction, isGraphNode, isGraphOperation, isMatcher, isNodeDefinition, } from '../types/graph';\nimport { sanitizeMusterType } from './serialize';\nimport { getMusterNodeTypesMap } from './types-registry';\nconst nodeTypes = mapValues(getMusterNodeTypesMap(), (nodeType) => ({\n    operations: Object.keys(nodeType.operations || {}),\n}));\nexport function inspect(store) {\n    const actionCaches = Array.from(store.actions.values());\n    const cachedActions = flatMap(actionCaches, (actionCache) => actionCache.cacheable ?

[[variable]] node, which is a node that can store values.\n * Its read and write process is synchronous.\n * Each variable node has an [[initialValue]] that defines both the node's starting\n * value and its fallback when reset. See the [[reset]] and \"**Resetting\n * variables**\" example to learn more about resetting [[variable]]s.\n *\n * Each muster instance has a separate node cache. This cache stores the latest resolved value of a\n * [[NodeDefinition]] for as long as there's something in the application that holds a subscription\n * to it. By default Muster does not store the values for every node. The act of\n * subscribing to a node (assuming it's a dynamic node) makes a new entry in the node cache.\n * One beneficial side effect of having this node cache is higher performance. An entry in\n * the application cache can be used in a case where some other part of the application\n * requests the value for a node that already has an open subscription. To save some computation\n * Muster can then just retrieve a value from the node cache instead of trying to re-calculate the\n * value. Each node cache entry holds a subscription count. When the count reaches 0 muster removes\n * the value from the node cache.\n *\n * A [[variable]] taps into this behaviour whenever a value is set to it.\n * The act of storing a value in a [[variable]] makes a new entry in the node cache and\n * artificially increases the subscription count for that entry. This means that the\n * [[variable]] does not clear its value when the subscription count reaches 0. In order\n * for the [[variable]] to clear its value we have to force it to reset. We do that with the\n * help of a [[reset]]. See \"**Resetting variables**\" example to learn more about this.\n *\n * @example **Basic variable**\n * ```ts\n * import muster, { ref, set, variable } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const app = muster({\n *   name: variable('Bob'),\n * });\n *\n * console.log('Retrieving a name');\n * app.resolve(ref('name')).subscribe((name) => {\n *   console.log(`Name: ${name}`);\n * });\n *\n * console.log('Setting a name to John');\n * await app.resolve(set('name', 'John'));\n *\n * // Console output:\n * // Retrieving a name\n * // Name: Bob\n * // Setting a name to John\n * // Name: John\n * ```\n * This example demonstrates how the variable node can be accessed and how to change its value.\n * See the [[set]] documentation for more information about how [[set]] works.\n * Contrary to how it might look, the process of setting the value of a [[variabled]] is\n * completely synchronous. The reason why the `await` keyword is used when setting is because\n * the [resolve](../modules/_utils_resolve_.html#resolve) method returns an object implementing\n * both the [[Observable]] and Promise APIs. This is because Muster allows for the graph to be\n * spread across multiple different environments. This means that parts of the graph can exist on a\n * remote server and accessing them is not a synchronous process. Learn more about this in the\n * [[remote]] and [[proxy]] documentation.\n *\n *\n * @example **Using variables in a computed node**\n * ```ts\n * import muster, { computed, ref, set, variable } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const app = muster({\n *   name: variable('Bob'),\n *   greeting: computed([ref('name')], (name) => `Hello ${name}`),\n * });\n *\n * console.log('Retrieving a greeting');\n * app.resolve(ref('greeting')).subscribe((greeting) => {\n *   console.log(greeting);\n * });\n *\n * console.log('Setting a name to Jane');\n * await app.resolve(set('name', 'Jane'));\n *\n * // Console output:\n * // Retrieving a greeting\n * // Hello Bob\n * // Setting a name to Jane\n * // Hello Jane\n * ```\n *\n *\n * @example **Persistence of stored value**\n * ```js\n * import muster, { ref, set, variable } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const app = muster({\n *   name: variable('Bob'),\n * });\n *\n * console.log('Retrieving a name');\n * const nameSubscription = app.resolve(ref('name')).subscribe((name) => {\n *   console.log(name);\n * });\n *\n * console.log('Setting a name to Jane');\n * await app.resolve(set('name', 'Jane'));\n *\n * console.log('Unsubscribing from name');\n * nameSubscription.unsubscribe();\n *\n * app.resolve(ref('name')).subscribe((name) => {\n *   console.log(`Re-subscribed name: ${name}`);\n * });\n *\n * // Console output:\n * // Retrieving a name\n * // Bob\n * // Setting a name to Jane\n * // Jane\n * // Unsubscribing from name\n * // Re-subscribed name: Jane\n * ```\n * This example presents the persistence of [[variable]] value even after losing all\n * subscriptions.\n *\n *\n * @example **Resetting variables**\n * ```ts\n * import muster, { ref, reset, set, variable } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const app = muster({\n *   name: variable('Bob'),\n * });\n *\n * app.resolve(ref('name')).subscribe((name) => {\n *   console.log(name);\n * });\n *\n * console.log('Changing name to Jane');\n * await app.resolve(set('name', 'Jane'));\n *\n * console.log('Resetting name');\n * await app.resolve(reset('name'));\n *\n * // Console output:\n * // Bob\n * // Changing name to Jane\n * // Jane\n * // Resetting name\n * // Bob\n * ```\n * This example shows how to restore the [[variable]] to its initial value with the help of a\n * [[reset]].\n *\n *\n * @example **Variable validators**\n * ```js\n * import muster, { set, types, variable } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const app = muster({\n *   name: variable('Bob', types.string),\n * });\n *\n * await app.resolve(set('name', 'Kate')); // OK\n *\n * await app.resolve(set('name', 123)); // Error\n * ```\n * Optionally, the [[variable]] node can also define a value validator using Muster types.\n */\nexport function variable(initialValue, validator = types.any) {\n    return createNodeDefinition(VariableNodeType, {\n        initialValue: toValue(initialValue),\n        validator,\n    });\n}\nexport function isVariableNodeDefinition(value) {\n    return value.type === VariableNodeType;\n}\nexport const EVENT_RESET_VARIABLE = '$$event:reset-variable';\nexport function resetVariablesInScope() {\n    return { type: EVENT_RESET_VARIABLE, payload: undefined };\n}\n//# sourceMappingURL=variable.js.map","import { isNodeDefinition, } from '../../types/graph';\nimport createNodeDefinition from '../../utils/create-node-definition';\nimport { createNodeType } from '../../utils/create-node-type';\nimport { getInvalidTypeErrorMessage } from '../../utils/get-invalid-type-error';\nimport * as graphTypes from '../../utils/graph-types';\nimport * as types from '../../utils/types';\nimport { value, ValueNodeType } from '../graph/value';\n/**\n * The implementation of the [[and]] node.\n * See the [[and]] documentation to learn more.\n */\nexport const AndNodeType = createNodeType('and', {\n    shape: {\n        operands: types.arrayOf(graphTypes.nodeDefinition),\n    },\n    operations: {\n        evaluate: {\n            getDependencies({ operands }) {\n                return operands.map((operand) => ({\n                    target: operand,\n                    until: {\n                        predicate: ValueNodeType.is,\n                        errorMessage(node) {\n                            return getInvalidTypeErrorMessage('And node operands must resolve to value() nodes', {\n                                expected: ValueNodeType,\n                                received: node.definition,\n                            });\n                        },\n                    },\n                }));\n            },\n            run(node, options, operands) {\n                return value(operands.every((operand) => Boolean(operand.definition.properties.value)));\n            },\n        },\n    },\n});\n/**\n * Creates a new instance of an [[and]] node, which introduces the `and` expression.

It's used internally by [ref](_nodes_graph_ref_.html#ref).\n *\n * Muster has a number of nodes which can be considered \"container-like\" nodes:\n * [[tree]], [[placeholder]], [[extend]], etc.\n *\n *\n * @example **Getting a child from a branch**\n * ```js\n * import muster, { get, tree, value } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const app = muster({\n *   name: 'from muster graph',\n * });\n *\n * const name = await app.resolve(get(\n *   tree({ name: value('from test branch') }),\n *   value('name'),\n * ));\n * // name === 'from test branch'\n * ```\n * [[get]]s operate in the context of a given root node. In this example we've chosen a new\n * [[tree]] to be our root node.\n *\n * If you want to access the name from the root of the muster graph, you can use a special\n * type of [[NodeDefinition]]: [[root]]. See the \"**Using root node**\" example for more information.\n *\n *\n * @example **Using the root node**\n * ```js\n * import muster, { get, root, value } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const app = muster({\n *   name: 'from muster graph',\n * });\n *\n * const name = await app.resolve(get(root(), value('name')));\n * // name === 'from muster graph'\n * ```\n *\n *\n * @example **Nesting get nodes**\n * ```js\n * import muster, { get, root, value } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const app = muster({\n *   user: {\n *     firstName: 'Bob',\n *   },\n * });\n *\n * const firstName = await app.resolve(\n *   get(\n *     get(root(), value('user')),\n *     value('firstName'),\n *   ),\n * );\n * // firstName === 'Bob'\n * // These nested get nodes are equivalent to: ref('user', 'firstName')\n * ```\n * Because the root of the [[get]] can be any [[NodeDefinition]], one can\n * make nested [[get]]s - the result of the inner get is used as the root of the outer.\n *\n * As this syntax is a bit clunky, Muster includes a [ref](_nodes_graph_ref_.html#ref) to help..\n */\nexport function get(subject, path) {\n    if (Array.isArray(path)) {\n        return composeNestedGet(subject, normalizePath(path));\n    }\n    return createNodeDefinition(GetNodeType, {\n        subject: toNode(subject),\n        key: toValue(path),\n    });\n}\nfunction composeNestedGet(root, path) {\n    if (path.length === 1) {\n        return createNodeDefinition(GetNodeType, {\n            subject: toNode(root),\n            key: toValue(path[0]),\n        });\n    }\n    const endIndex = path.length - 1;\n    const currentPath = path[endIndex];\n    const remainingParts = path.slice(0, endIndex);\n    return get(composeNestedGet(root, remainingParts), currentPath);\n}\nfunction normalizePath(input) {\n    return Array.isArray(input) ? input.map(toValue) : [toValue(input)];\n}\nexport function isGetNodeDefinition(value) {\n    return value.type === GetNodeType;\n}\nexport const PARENT = Symbol('PARENT');\nexport const PARENT_SCOPE_PATH_KEY = Symbol('PARENT_SCOPE_PATH_KEY');\nconst PATH_KEY = Symbol('PATH_KEY');\nexport function getPath(context) {\n    if (!contextHasPathKey(context)) {\n        // TODO: Remove the `as any` cast once https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/1863 is resolved\n        if (context.values[PARENT_SCOPE_PATH_KEY]) {\n            // TODO: Remove the `as any` cast once https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/1863 is resolved\n            return context.values[PARENT_SCOPE_PATH_KEY].definition.properties.value;\n        }\n        return [];\n    }\n    const currentPathKey = getContextPathKey(context);\n    const parentPathContext = getParentPathContext(context);\n    return parentPathContext ?

The process of getting items out of collection requires the use of a\n * [[query]] with an [[entries]]. See the [[query]] documentation to learn more about\n * building queries.\n *\n * The query to the [[collection]] resolves to an [[array]], which behaves just like a\n * [value](_nodes_graph_value_.html#value) but stores an array of [[NodeDefinition]]s.\n *\n * It is possible to get items from a [[collection]] by just resolving a [ref](_utils_ref_.html#ref), but such\n * `ref` resolves into a [[nodeList]] which contains the item nodes as well as their scopes.\n * This representation form is used internally when making references between collections but is not\n * really useful for apps consuming these items.\n *\n *\n * @example **Filtering collections**\n * ```js\n * import muster, { collection, filter, gt, entries, query, ref } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const app = muster({\n *   numbers: collection(\n *     [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],\n *     [\n *       // Filter items with a value greater than 3\n *       filter((item) => gt(item, 3))\n *     ],\n *   ),\n * });\n *\n * const numbers = await app.resolve(query(ref('numbers'), entries()));\n * // numbers === [4, 5]\n * ```\n * This example shows the basic use of the [[filter]] transform. Here the transform is applied\n * directly to the numbers collection, but it is also possible to apply the transform in the query.\n * See the \"**Building the query with transforms**\" example to learn more.\n *\n *\n * @example **Building the query with transforms**\n * ```js\n * import muster, { filter, gt, entries, query, ref, withTransforms } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const app = muster({\n *   numbers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],\n * });\n *\n * const numbers = await app.resolve(query(ref('numbers'), withTransforms([\n *   filter((item) => gt(item, 3)),\n * ], entries())));\n * // numbers === [4, 5]\n * ```\n * This example shows how to include additional collection transforms within a query.\n * It gives the same output as the code from the \"**Filtering collections**\" example.\n *\n *\n * @example **Linking collections**\n * ```js\n * import muster, { collection, filter, gt, entries, query, ref } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const app = muster({\n *   originalNumbers: [1, 2, 3],\n *   filteredNumbers: collection(\n *     ref('originalNumbers'),\n *     [filter((item) => gt(item, 1))],\n *   ),\n *   allNumbers: collection(ref('originalNumbers')),\n * });\n * const filteredNumbers = await app.resolve(\n *   query(ref('filteredNumbers'), entries()),\n * );\n * // filteredNumbers === [2, 3]\n *\n * const allNumbers = await app.resolve(\n *   query(ref('allNumbers'), entries()),\n * );\n * // allNumbers === [1, 2, 3]\n * ```\n * As mentioned in the introduction above, [[collection]]s can use\n * another [[collection]] as a data source.

It lets you skip a number of items from the start and define the number of items to return.\n * One use case for this node is returning paginated items.\n * It behaves in a similar way to the JavaScript's `Array.slice()` method.\n *\n * The [[slice]] allows for three forms of specifying the range:\n * - `slice({ offset: number, length: number })`\n * - `slice({ from: number, to: number })`\n * - `slice({ begin: number, end: number })`\n *\n *\n * @example **Simple range selection**\n * ```js\n * import muster, { entries, key, query, ref, slice, withTransforms } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const app = muster({\n *   numbers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],\n * });\n *\n * const firstTwoNumbers = await app.resolve(query(ref('numbers'), withTransforms([\n *   slice({ offset: 0, length: 2 }),\n * ], entries())));\n * // firstTwoNumbers = [1, 2]\n *\n * const otherTwoNumbers = await app.resolve(query(ref('numbers'), withTransforms([\n *   slice({ offset: 2, length: 2 }),\n * ], entries())));\n * // otherTwoNumbers = [3, 4]\n * ```\n * This example shows how to take two items out of a collection with the help of a\n * [[slice]].\n *\n *\n * @example **Paginated collection**\n * ```ts\n * import muster, {\n *   applyTransforms,\n *   entries,\n *   key,\n *   multiply,\n *   query,\n *   ref,\n *   set,\n *   slice,\n *   variable,\n * } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const app = muster({\n *   pageSize: 2,\n *   pageIndex: variable(0),\n *   pageOffset: multiply(ref('pageIndex'), ref('pageSize')),\n *   numbers: applyTransforms(\n *     [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],\n *     [slice({ offset: ref('pageOffset'), length: ref('pageSize') })]\n *   ),\n * });\n *\n * app.resolve(query(ref('numbers'), entries())).subscribe((items: any) => {\n *   console.log(items);\n * });\n *\n * console.log('Changing page index to 1');\n * await app.resolve(set('pageIndex', 1));\n *\n * // Console output:\n * // [1, 2]\n * // Changing page index to 1\n * // [3, 4]\n * ```\n * This example shows how to implement the simple pagination of a local collection.\n */\nexport function slice(range) {\n    if (isRelativeSliceBounds(range)) {\n        return createNodeDefinition(SliceNodeType,

define the ordering of the sort.\n * The items of the [[order]] array are assuming a descending order of\n * priority, with the first item having the highest priority and the last one having the lowest.\n *\n * For example, given the following items:\n * <table>\n *   <thead>\n *     <tr>\n *       <th>Make</th>\n *       <th>Model</th>\n *       <th>Year</th>\n *     </tr>\n *   </thead>\n *   <tbody>\n *     <tr>\n *       <td>Mercedes</td>\n *       <td>C 63 AMG</td>\n *       <td>2017</td>\n *     </tr>\n *     <tr>\n *       <td>Mercedes</td>\n *       <td>A</td>\n *       <td>2009</td>\n *     </tr>\n *     <tr>\n *       <td>Audi</td>\n *       <td>R8</td>\n *       <td>2013</td>\n *     </tr>\n *     <tr>\n *       <td>Audi</td>\n *       <td>A4</td>\n *       <td>2018</td>\n *     </tr>\n *     <tr>\n *       <td>Toyota</td>\n *       <td>Corolla</td>\n *       <td>2016</td>\n *     </tr>\n *   </tbody>\n * </table>\n * When the sort order is defined as:\n * <ol>\n *   <li>Sort by `Make` ascending</li>\n *   <li>Sort by `Year` descending</li>\n * </ol>\n * The table should look like:\n * <table>\n *   <thead>\n *     <tr>\n *       <th>Make</th>\n *       <th>Model</th>\n *       <th>Year</th>\n *     </tr>\n *   </thead>\n *   <tbody>\n *     <tr>\n *       <td>Audi</td>\n *       <td>A4</td>\n *       <td>2018</td>\n *     </tr>\n *     <tr>\n *       <td>Audi</td>\n *       <td>R8</td>\n *       <td>2013</td>\n *     </tr>\n *     <tr>\n *       <td>Mercedes</td>\n *       <td>C 63 AMG</td>\n *       <td>2017</td>\n *     </tr>\n *     <tr>\n *       <td>Mercedes</td>\n *       <td>A</td>\n *       <td>2009</td>\n *     </tr>\n *     <tr>\n *       <td>Toyota</td>\n *       <td>Corolla</td>\n *       <td>2016</td>\n *     </tr>\n *   </tbody>\n * </table>\n *\n * Sort order can be defined with the help of two helper functions:\n * - [[ascending]]\n * - [[descending]]\n *\n * @example **Sorting numbers**\n * ```js\n * import muster, {\n *   ascending,\n *   descending,\n *   entries,\n *   query,\n *   ref,\n *   sort,\n *   withTransforms,\n * } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const app = muster({\n *   numbers: [5, 3, 2, 4, 1],\n * });\n *\n * const ascendingNumbers = await app.resolve(query(ref('numbers'), withTransforms([\n *   sort(ascending((item) => item)),\n * ], entries())));\n * // ascendingNumbers === [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n *\n * const descendingNumbers = await app.resolve(query(ref('numbers'), withTransforms([\n *   sort(descending((item) => item)),\n * ], entries())));\n * // descendingNumbers === [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n * ```\n * This example shows how to apply the most basic sort transform. Although the [[sort]]\n * officially takes an array of sort orders, you can still define a [[sort]] with\n * a single [[sortOrder]].\n *\n * Note that the [[ascending]] and [[descending]] node factories are called with a function\n * returning its parameter (same as `identity` from lodash). You might expect that this function\n * receives an instance of the item, but that's not the case.

These requests may retrieve or update data\n * from a remote service.\n *\n * The [[fromPromise]] allows for handling `set` requests through a [set](_nodes_graph_set_.html#set).\n * See the \"**Handling set requests**\" example for more information.\n *\n *\n * @example **Basic promise node**\n * ```ts\n * import muster, { fromPromise, ref } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const app = muster({\n *   asyncName: fromPromise(() => Promise.resolve('async name')),\n * });\n *\n * // Resolving with 'await'\n * const awaitName = await app.resolve(ref('asyncName'));\n * // awaitName === 'async name'\n *\n * // Resolving with streams\n * let streamName = 'initial';\n * app.resolve(ref('asyncName')).subscribe((name) => {\n *   // name === 'async name'\n *   // streamName === 'initial'\n *   streamName = name;\n *   // streamName === 'async name'\n * });\n * // streamName === 'initial'\n * ```\n * This example demonstrates the asynchronous nature of [[fromPromise]]. When the ref is\n * requested with `await` it forces the code to wait for the [[fromPromise]] to emit a value.\n * Internally Muster requires every [[NodeDefinition]] to emit its value synchronously. To get around\n * that, [[fromPromise]] initially returns a [[pending]], then an updated value when the\n * promise resolves.\n *\n * The reason why in the example code the [[pending]] isn't emitted to the \"outside\n * world\" is that these values are internal to muster and are filtered out before returning the\n * response.\n *\n *\n * @example **Promise factory params**\n * ```js\n * import muster, { fromPromise, match, ref, tree, types, value } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const app = muster({\n *   user: {\n *     [match(types.string, 'id')]: fromPromise(({ id }) =>\n *       // You could make a request to an API endpoint here...\n *       Promise.resolve(tree({\n *         id: value(id),\n *         name: value(`User ${id}`),\n *       })),\n *     ),\n *   },\n * });\n *\n * const user1Name = await app.resolve(ref('user', '1', 'name'));\n * // user1Name === 'User 1'\n *\n * const user2Name = await app.resolve(ref('user', '2', 'name'));\n * // user2Name === 'User 2'\n * ```\n * This example demonstrates a real-world case of requesting user data based on their ID. Note the\n * promise factory in [[fromPromise]] receives a parameter with one field: `id`.\n *\n *\n * @example **Implementing set promise factory**\n * ```ts\n * import muster, { fromPromise, ref, set, tree } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const userSettings = {\n *   homepage: 'https://www.db.com',\n * };\n *\n * const app = muster({\n *   homepage: fromPromise({\n *     // Make an API request instead\n *     get: () => Promise.resolve(userSettings.homepage),\n *     // Make an API request instead\n *     set: (params, newValue) => new Promise((resolve) => {\n *       userSettings.homepage = newValue;\n *       resolve();\n *     }),\n *   }),\n * });\n *\n * let setTriggered = false;\n *\n * // Subscribe to the 'homepage'\n * console.log('Requesting homepage');\n * app.resolve(ref('homepage')).subscribe((homepage) => {\n *   console.log(`Homepage: ${homepage}`);\n *   !setTriggered && triggerSet();\n * });\n *\n * async function triggerSet() {\n *   setTriggered = true;\n *   console.log('Setting homepage');\n *   await app.resolve(set('homepage', 'https://wwww.github.com'));\n * }\n *\n * // Console output:\n * // Requesting homepage\n * // Homepage: https://www.db.com\n * // Setting homepage\n * // Homepage: https://www.github.com\n * ```\n */\nexport function fromPromise(definition, setFactory) {\n    return createNodeDefinition(FromPromiseNodeType, {\n        get: typeof definition === 'function' ?

In the example code above the first dependency was set to `undefined`, which tells\n * the [[injectDependencies]] node that this is not a real value, and it should resolve it as normally, but the second\n * dependency is defined. This means that the `combine` function of the [[computed]] node is called with\n * `left = ref('four') => 4` and `right = 3`.\n */\nexport function injectDependencies(target, dependencies, context) {\n    return createNodeDefinition(InjectDependenciesNodeType, {\n        target,\n        dependencies: dependencies.map((dependency) => isNodeDefinition(dependency)\n            ? dependency\n            : dependency === undefined\n                ? undefined\n                : value(dependency)),\n        context: context &&\n            mapValues(context, (contextValue) => isNodeDefinition(contextValue) ? contextValue : value(contextValue)),\n    });\n}\nexport function isInjectDependenciesNodeDefinition(value) {\n    return value.type === InjectDependenciesNodeType;\n}\nfunction getDependencies(properties, handler, operation) {\n    const { target, dependencies: suppliedDependencies, context: suppliedContext } = properties;\n    const targetDependencies = handler.getDependencies(target, operation);\n    const dependencies = targetDependencies.map((dependency, index) => {\n        const suppliedValue = suppliedDependencies[index];\n        if (!suppliedValue) {\n            return dependency;\n        }\n        return {\n            target: suppliedValue,\n            operation: dependency.operation,\n            allowErrors: dependency.allowErrors,\n            allowPending: dependency.allowPending,\n            invalidate: dependency.invalidate,\n        };\n    });\n    const targetContextDependencies = handler.getContextDependencies(target, operation);\n    if (!suppliedContext) {\n        return dependencies;\n    }\n    const suppliedContextDependencies = targetContextDependencies\n        .filter((dependency) => dependency.name in suppliedContext)\n        .map((dependency) => \n    // TODO: Remove the `as any` cast once https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/1863 is resolved\n    [dependency, suppliedContext[dependency.name]])\n        .map(([dependency, suppliedValue]) => parseNodeDependency(suppliedValue, dependency));\n    return [...dependencies, ...suppliedContextDependencies];\n}\nfunction getContextDependencies(properties, handler, operation) {\n    const { target, context: suppliedContext = {} } = properties;\n    const requiredContextDependencies = handler.getContextDependencies(target, operation);\n    const missingContextDependencies = requiredContextDependencies\n        // TODO: Remove the `as any` cast once https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/1863 is resolved\n        .filter((dependency, index) => !suppliedContext[dependency.name])\n        .map((dependency) => (Object.assign({}, dependency, { until: shallow })));\n    return missingContextDependencies;\n}\nfunction getResolvedDependencies(definition, handler, operation, dependencies, contextDependencies) {\n    const { target, context: suppliedContext = {} } = definition.properties;\n    const targetDependencies = handler.getDependencies(target, operation);\n    const targetContextDependencies = handler.getContextDependencies(target, operation);\n    const resolvedDependencies = dependencies.slice(0, targetDependencies.length);\n    const resolvedSuppliedContextDependencies = dependencies.slice(targetDependencies.length);\n    const resolvedContextDependencies = targetContextDependencies.reduce((acc, dependency, index) => \n    // TODO: Remove the `as any` cast once https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/1863 is resolved\n    suppliedContext[dependency.name]\n        ?

[[isPending]] and the [[defer]].\n *\n * A [[legacyQuery]] resolves into a [[tree]], an [[array]] or a [[value]] (depending on\n * the type of the legacyQuery made). These can be easily converted into plain JS objects\n * with the [[valueOf]] helper. This conversion is reversible through the use of\n * [[toNode]] helper.\n *\n *\n * @example **Basic legacyQuery**\n * ```js\n * import muster, { key, legacyQuery, root, valueOf } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const app = muster({\n *   firstName: 'Rosalind',\n *   lastName: 'Franklin',\n *   dateOfBirth: 1948,\n * });\n *\n * const user = await app.resolve(legacyQuery(root(), {\n *   userFirstName: key('firstName'),\n *   lastName: key('lastName'),\n * }));\n * // user = {\n * //   userFirstName: 'Rosalind',\n * //   lastName: 'Franklin',\n * // }\n * ```\n * This example shows how to use a [[legacyQuery]] to request two [[NodeDefinition]] at the same\n * time. The `legacyQuery` call consists of: the first argument which defines the graph starting point from which\n * legacyQuery should begin the traversal; and the second argument, an object (implicitly cast to a [[fields]]) which\n * defines a map of fields to retrieve from the graph. The name of each property in that map\n * corresponds to the name in the output [[tree]]. Note that this name does not have to be the same\n * as the name in the [[key]] on the right of that property. Take the `firstName` graph node\n * and its corresponding `userFirstName` name in the legacyQuery. The ability to override the name of a\n * node is useful especially when a given [[NodeDefinition]] can be accessed in more than one way.\n * This behaviour is used extensively by the [[proxy]], and by extension the [[remote]], when\n * building a legacyQuery to a remote node.\n *\n * The [[key]] used in this legacyQuery defines the name of a given node in the graph. Additionally, the\n * [[key]] can define a map of child nodes to retrieve from that node. See the \"**Getting values of\n * nested nodes**\" example for more information.\n *\n * A [[legacyQuery]] resolves into a combination of [[tree]]s, [[array]]s and [[value]]s.\n * This means an output of one legacyQuery can be used as an input for another [[NodeDefinition]] and even\n * another [[legacyQuery]].\n *\n *\n * @example **Getting async values**\n * ```js\n * import muster, { fromPromise, key, legacyQuery, root } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * let resolvePromise1;\n * const app = muster({\n *   name: 'sync name',\n *   asyncName: fromPromise(() =>\n *     new Promise((res) => resolvePromise1 = res)\n *       .then(() => 'async name'),\n *   ),\n * });\n *\n * console.log('Making the legacyQuery');\n * app.resolve(legacyQuery(root(), {\n *   name: key('name'),\n *   asyncName: key('asyncName'),\n * })).subscribe((res) => {\n *   console.log(res);\n * });\n *\n * console.log('Resolving the promise');\n * resolvePromise1();\n *\n * // Console output:\n * // Making the legacyQuery\n * // Resolving the promise\n * // {\n * //   name: 'sync name',\n * //   asyncName: 'async name',\n * // }\n * ```\n * The [[legacyQuery]] by default waits for every part of the legacyQuery to resolve to a non-pending and\n * non-dynamic value. This example demonstrates this behaviour with the help of [[fromPromise]].\n * Note that the legacyQuery output gets logged only once - after the promise is resolved. Muster can\n * also mark certain parts of the legacyQuery with [[defer]]s. This instructs Muster\n * to return the legacyQuery result even if that part of the legacyQuery is loading. See the \"**Defer part of the\n * legacyQuery**\" example for more information.\n *\n *\n * @example **Getting values of nested nodes**\n * ```js\n * import muster, { key, legacyQuery, root } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const app = muster({\n *   user: {\n *     firstName: 'Rosalind',\n *     lastName: 'Franklin',\n *   },\n * });\n *\n * const user = await app.resolve(legacyQuery(root(), {\n *   user: key('user', {\n *     firstName: key('firstName'),\n *   }),\n * }));\n * // user = {\n * //   user: {\n * //     firstName: 'Rosalind',\n * //   },\n * // }\n * ```\n * The [[legacyQuery]] can extract values from nested [[NodeDefinition]]s. As shown\n * in the previous example, the [[legacyQuery]] factory function performs an implicit conversion to a\n * [[fields]]. This saves developers from having to explicitly write unnecessarily verbose code.\n * The same functionality is available in the [[key]]. When the factory is\n * called with a pure JS object, it will recursively cast it to a [[fields]].\n *\n * Sometimes, the second argument to the [[key]] won't be a pure JS object. For\n * example, when a developer wants to get items from a collection. [[fields]] lets the\n * legacyQuery know that a target [[NodeDefinition]] is expected to be a container-like node. This assumption\n * breaks apart when requesting a collection. To request items from collections, one has to make a\n * legacyQuery with an [[entries]] instead of a [[fields]]. See the \"**Getting atomic items from a\n * collection**\" example to find out more.\n *\n *\n * @example **Getting atomic items from a collection**\n * ```js\n * import muster, { entries, key, legacyQuery, root } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const app = muster({\n *   numbers: [1, 2, 3, 4],\n * });\n *\n * const numbers = await app.resolve(legacyQuery(root(), {\n *   numbers: key('numbers', entries()),\n * }));\n * // numbers = {\n * //   numbers: [1, 2, 3, 4],\n * // }\n * ```\n * An [[entries]] can be provided instead of a [[fields]] to instruct the [[legacyQuery]] to retrieve\n * all items from a given graph node. In this example, we had it easy: every item is an atomic\n * value. The fun with [[legacyQuery]]s and collections does not end here. See the \"**Getting specific\n * fields from items**\" example to learn more about selecting certain fields from items.\n *\n *\n * @example **Getting specific fields from items**\n * ```js\n * import muster, { entries, key, legacyQuery, ref } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const app = muster({\n *   books: [\n *     { name: 'The Expeditionary Force', author: 'Craig Alanson' },\n *     { name: 'Fear The Sky', author: 'Stephen Moss' },\n *     { name: 'After It Happened', author: 'Devon Ford' },\n *   ],\n * });\n *\n * const bookNames = await app.resolve(legacyQuery(ref('books'), entries({\n *   name: key('name'),\n * })));\n * // bookNames = [\n * //   { name: 'The Expeditionary Force' },\n * //   { name: 'Fear The Sky' },\n * //   { name: 'After It Happened' },\n * // ]\n * ```\n * In this example, apart from getting just a selected field from each item in the collection, we\n * demonstrated another feature of the [[legacyQuery]]: changing its starting point.\n * In all previous examples, we've used a [[root]] as the starting point of the legacyQuery, but this time\n * to make the output shorter we've changed it to a `books` collection.\n *\n *\n * @example **Creating setters**\n * ```js\n * import muster, {\n *   createSetter,\n *   key,\n *   legacyQuery,\n *   root,\n *   variable,\n * } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const app = muster({\n *   name: variable('initial'),\n * });\n *\n * console.log('Making a legacyQuery for `name`');\n * app.resolve(legacyQuery(root(), { name: key('name') })).subscribe((result) => {\n *   console.log(result);\n * });\n *\n * console.log('Making a legacyQuery for setter function');\n * const result = await app.resolve(legacyQuery(root(), {\n *   setName: createSetter('name'),\n * }));\n *\n * console.log('Calling a setter');\n * result.setName('updated');\n *\n * // Console output:\n * // Making a legacyQuery for `name`\n * // initial\n * // Making a legacyQuery for setter function\n * // Calling a setter\n * // updated\n * ```\n * This example shows how a [[legacyQuery]] can be used when there's a need for imperative call\n * to a set method. This setter function can be used, for example,\n * when integrating with view frameworks such as React, Vue etc.\n * Muster-React uses this way of creating setters extensively. Similarly, there's a\n * [[createCaller]] node which allows for imperative calls to actions.\n *\n * [[createSetter]]s and [[createCaller]]s should be used only when the output of the legacyQuery\n * is used outside the \"Muster world\". Inside Muster code, using [[call]]s\n * [[apply]]s and [[set]]s is recommended for these kinds of actions.\n *\n *\n * @example **Defer part of a legacyQuery**\n * ```js\n * import muster, { defer, fromPromise, key, legacyQuery, root } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * let resolvePromise2;\n * const app = muster({\n *   name: 'sync name',\n *   asyncName: fromPromise(() =>\n *     new Promise((res) => resolvePromise2 = res)\n *       .then(() => 'async name'),\n *   ),\n * });\n *\n * console.log('Requesting the legacyQuery');\n * app.resolve(legacyQuery(root(), {\n *   name: key('name'),\n *   asyncName: defer('asyncName'),\n * })).subscribe((res) => {\n *   console.log(res);\n * });\n *\n * console.log('Resolving the promise');\n * resolvePromise2();\n *\n * // Console output:\n * // Requesting the legacyQuery\n * // {\n * //   name: 'sync name',\n * //   asyncName: null,\n * // }\n * // Resolving the promise\n * // {\n * //   name: 'sync name',\n * //   asyncName: 'async name',\n * // }\n * ```\n * This example demonstrates how to instruct a [[legacyQuery]] to return the output of its legacyQuery\n * even if a given [[NodeDefinition]] is in a pending state. The legacyQuery is built with a\n * [[defer]]. This example uses a shorthand syntax for the `defer(...)` node.\n * Internally, the node converts the argument to a [[key]]:\n * ```js\n * import { defer, key } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * defer('asyncName');\n * // is equivalent to\n * defer(key('name'));\n * ```\n * The [[defer]] also enables the defer part of the legacyQuery to return a previously loaded\n * (stale) value of the target node. See the \"**Defer with previous value**\" example for more\n * information.\n *\n *\n * @example **Check if defer part of the legacyQuery is loading**\n * ```js\n * import muster, {\n *   defer,\n *   fromPromise,\n *   isPending,\n *   key,\n *   legacyQuery,\n *   root,\n * } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * let resolvePromise3;\n * const app = muster({\n *   name: 'sync name',\n *   asyncName: fromPromise(() =>\n *     new Promise((res) => resolvePromise3 = res)\n *       .then(() => 'async name'),\n *   ),\n * });\n *\n * console.log('Requesting the legacyQuery');\n * app.resolve(legacyQuery(root(), {\n *   name: key('name'),\n *   asyncName: defer('asyncName'),\n *   isLoadingAsyncName: isPending('asyncName'),\n * })).subscribe((res) => {\n *   console.log(res);\n * });\n *\n * console.log('Resolving the promise');\n * resolvePromise3();\n *\n * // Console output:\n * // Requesting the legacyQuery\n * // {\n * //   name: 'sync name',\n * //   asyncName: null,\n * //   isLoadingAsyncName: true,\n * // }\n * // Resolving the promise\n * // {\n * //   name: 'sync name',\n * //   asyncName: 'async name',\n * //   isLoadingAsyncName: false,\n * // }\n * ```\n * This example presents the use of the [[isPending]]. When used in a legacyQuery, this node checks if\n * a part of the legacyQuery is currently loading. Similarly to the [[defer]],\n * the [[isPending]] factory function implicitly converts its argument to a [[key]].\n * ```js\n * import { isPending, key } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * isPending('asyncName');\n * // is equivalent to\n * isPending(key('asyncName'))\n * ```\n */\nexport function legacyQuery(root, keys) {\n    return createNodeDefinition(LegacyQueryNodeType, {\n

The conversion follows these rules:\n * - Any [[NodeDefinition]], e.g. [[value]], [[computed]] etc. remains unchanged.\n * - A simple value e.g. `string`, `number`, `Date`, etc. is converted to a [[value]].\n * - A plain object e.g. `{ firstName: 'Bob', lastName: 'Builder' }` is converted to a [[tree]].\n *   Each property of that branch is recursively converted using these rules.\n * - An array of simple values e.g. `[1, 2, 3]` is converted to an [[array]] with each item\n *   being converted to a [[value]].\n * - An array of plain objects e.g. `[{ name: 'first' }, { name: 'second' }]` is converted to an\n *   [[array]] with each item being converted to a [[tree]]. Each property of that\n *   branch is recursively converted using these rules.\n * You can find more about default conversions in the [[graph]] helper documentation.\n *\n * **Important notice:** Values of the graph nodes are evaluated only when a subscription for a node\n * is made. Subscriptions can be created in two ways:\n * - Explicitly - by calling `app.resolve(nodeToSubscribe)`, where nodeToSubscribe is a [[NodeDefinition]]\n *   to subscribe to\n * - Implicitly - by returning a dynamic node from [[NodeType]] operation implementation.\n *\n * See \"**Lazy-evaluating values**\" example for a code example.\n *\n * @returns Configured instance of the muster app.\n *\n *\n * @example **Creating basic muster application**\n * ```js\n * import muster from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const app = muster({\n *   firstName: 'John',\n *   lastName: 'Doe',\n *   age: 43,\n * });\n * ```\n * This example creates a muster application containing three nodes:\n * * `firstName`: [[value]] = `'John'`\n * * `lastName`: [[value]] = `'Doe'`\n * * `age`: [[value]] = `43`\n *\n *\n * @example **Accessing data from a muster graph**\n * ```js\n * import muster from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const app = muster({ firstName: 'John' });\n * ```\n * First let's create a simple muster instance with a graph containing a single leaf [[value]]\n * `firstName`. Now we have an instance of muster we can make queries against it:\n * ```js\n * import muster, { ref } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const app = muster({ firstName: 'John' });\n *\n * const firstName = await app.resolve(ref('firstName'));\n * ```\n * The [[Muster]] object exposes a `resolve` method which can be used for running queries against\n * muster. In this example we've used a [[ref]]. This helper is used to locate and return a graph\n * node based on its path in the graph. The path in the graph is defined by the hierarchy of branches\n * that exist in the muster graph. In this example we have just one branch containing a single leaf\n * `firstName`. You can find out more about paths and branches in the [[ref]] and [[tree]]\n * documentation.\n *\n * `app.resolve` returns an object implementing both [[Observable]] and [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) APIs.\n * In this example we have retrieved the current value of the `firstName` node with the use of the [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) API.\n * Alternatively this can also be done with [[Observable]] by subscribing to the returned observable:\n * ```js\n * import muster, { ref } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const app = muster({ firstName: 'John' });\n *\n * const unsubscribe = app.resolve(ref('firstName')).subscribe((firstName) => {\n *   // Do something with the first name as it changes over time\n * });\n * ```\n * By nature, muster tries to execute the code synchronously when it can, so the callback of the\n * `subscribe` will be called immediately with the latest value of `firstName`. In this example\n * `firstName` resolves to a `'John'` string.\n *\n * **Notice:** `subscribe` has one important advantage over `await`. It responds to changes in the\n * subscribed query over time. Consider an example where the `firstName` is a node whose value\n * changes while the application is running. `Promise` will emit the value as soon as it's\n * available but won't cause your code to be re-run when the value of the subscribed node changes.\n * On the other hand, [[Observable]] will re-emit a new value causing the subscriber (the function used\n * to create the subscription) to be executed again with a new value.\n *\n * See [[variable]], [[fromPromise]] and [[fromStream]] for more information about\n * settable nodes.\n *\n *\n * @example **Creating muster application with branches**\n * ```js\n * import muster, { computed, ref } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const app = muster({\n *   user: {\n *     firstName: 'John',\n *     lastName: 'Doe',\n *     fullName: computed([\n *       ref('user', 'firstName'),\n *       ref('user', 'lastName'),\n *     ], (firstName, lastName) => `${firstName} ${lastName}`),\n *   },\n * });\n * ```\n * This example creates a muster application where the graph has one branch `user` ([[tree]]).\n * That branch has three leaves:\n * * `firstName`: [[value]] = `'John'`\n * * `lastname`: [[value]] = `'Doe'`\n * * `fullName`: [[computed]] = A node which computes full name of the user based on the current\n *   value of `firstName` and `lastName`.\n *\n * Note the `fullName` [[computed]] dependencies are defined using fully qualified path of the\n * nodes in the graph. This could have been simplified with the use of a [[relative]] helper\n * function:\n * ```js\n * import muster, { computed, ref, relative } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const app = muster({\n *   user: {\n *     firstName: 'John',\n *     lastName: 'Doe',\n *     fullName: computed([\n *       ref(relative('firstName')),\n *       ref(relative('lastName')),\n *     ], (firstName, lastName) => `${firstName} ${lastName}`),\n *   },\n * });\n * ```\n * The benefit of using [[relative]] instead of defining the full path is apparent when refactoring the\n * application graph. Imagine a scenario when the `user` branch is to be renamed to `currentUser`.\n * In this scenario, when the full path is used we'd have to change the name in three places: branch\n * definitions and both references.\n * It would be much simpler with the use of [[relative]] helper: we'd have to only rename the\n * branch.\n *\n * You can find out more about [[relative]] helper on its documentation.\n *\n *\n * @example **Lazy-evaluating values**\n * ```js\n * import muster, { computed, ref } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * let externalValue = 'initial';\n *\n * const app = muster({\n *   testComputed: computed([], () => {\n *     externalValue = 'updated';\n *     return true;\n *   }),\n * });\n *\n * // externalValue === 'initial'\n *\n * const subscription = app.resolve(ref('testComputed'));\n *\n * // externalValue === 'initial'\n *\n * const unsubscribe = subscription.subscribe((testComputedValue) => {\n *   // externalValue === 'updated'\n *   // testComputedValue === true\n * });\n *\n * // externalValue === 'updated'\n * ```\n * This example demonstrates the principle of lazy evaluation in muster. In muster the value of\n * every node is evaluated only when a subscription is created to that node. Note how the value of\n * `externalValue` changes in this example. Thanks to the synchronous code execution in muster the\n * `externalValue` is set to the new value before the first line of the subscriber callback as well\n * as after the call to the `subscribe` method.\n *\n * Most of the Muster [[NodeDefinition]]s are synchronous, with exception of [[fromPromise]],\n * [[fromStream]] (depending on the type of stream used), [[action]], [[proxy]] and\n * [[remote]].\n *\n * @example **Complex queries**\n * ```js\n * import muster, { key, query, root } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const app = muster({\n *   user: {\n *     firstName: 'Bob',\n *     lastName: 'Johnson',\n *   },\n * });\n *\n * const userTree = await app.resolve(query(root(), {\n *   user: key('user', {\n *     firstName: key('firstName'),\n *     lastName: key('lastName'),\n *   }),\n * }));\n * // userTree is a JS object with all of the requested branches encoded in it:\n * // {\n * //   user: {\n * //     firstName: 'Bob',\n * //     lastName: 'Johnson',\n * //   },\n * // }\n * ```\n * In previous examples we've been requesting a single [[NodeDefinition]] at a time. In real world apps\n * this would not be the most efficient or fastest way of writing code. For this reason Muster\n * comes with a [[query]] which allows for building complex queries. These queries define the\n * shape of their output data as well as the place from the graph this data is to be retrieved from. See\n * the [[query]] documentation to learn more about queries.\n */\nexport default function muster(root, options) {\n    return new Muster(toNode(root), {\n        debug: !(options && options.debug

See the \"**Tree matchers**\" example for more information.\n *\n * This node is serializable.\n *\n *\n * @example **Simple trees**\n * ```js\n * import { tree, value } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const myTree = tree({\n *   firstName: value('Bob'),\n *   lastName: value('Builder'),\n * });\n * ```\n * In this example we have created a tree with two string-based tree matchers:\n * - `firstName`\n * - `lastName`\n *\n * The content of each tree can be any [[NodeDefinition]]. In this example, both of these trees\n * contain [[value]]s.\n *\n * To access the contents of the `firstName` tree we'd first have to place it in a muster graph.\n * ```js\n * import muster, { tree, value } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const myTree = tree({\n *   firstName: value('Bob'),\n *   lastName: value('Builder'),\n * });\n *\n * const app = muster(myTree);\n * ```\n * As it happens, we chose to place our tree in the root of the muster graph.\n * Then we can just make a query for first name:\n * ```js\n * import muster, { tree, ref, value } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const myTree = tree({\n *   firstName: value('Bob'),\n *   lastName: value('Builder'),\n * });\n *\n * const app = muster(myTree);\n *\n * const firstNameValue = await app.resolve(ref('firstName'));\n * // firstNameValue === 'Bob'\n * ```\n *\n * See the [[muster]] helper documentation for more information on how to create an instance of muster.\n *\n *\n * @example **Nested trees**\n * ```js\n * import muster, { tree, ref, value } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const app = muster(tree({\n *   currentUser: tree({\n *     firstName: value('Bob'),\n *     lastName: value('Builder'),\n *   }),\n * }));\n *\n * const firstNameValue = await app.resolve(ref('currentUser', 'firstName'));\n * // firstNameValue === 'Bob'\n * ```\n * As mentioned before, the content [[tree]]'s tree can be any [[NodeDefinition]]. This allows\n * for the creation of nested trees.\n *\n * In this example we have created a tree `currentUser` which contains a tree with two leaves:\n * `firstName` and `lastName`.\n *\n * To access `firstName` from the `currentUser` we can use a [[ref]] and just specify the full\n * path: `ref('currentUser', 'firstName')`.\n *\n *\n * @example **Computed trees**\n * ```js\n * import muster, { tree, computed, ref, value } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const app = muster(tree({\n *   name: value('Bob'),\n *   currentUser: computed([ref('name')], (name) =>\n *     tree({\n *       firstName: value(name),\n *     }),\n *   ),\n * }));\n *\n * const firstName = await app.resolve(ref('currentUser', 'firstName'));\n * // firstName === 'Bob'\n * ```\n * Trees in muster do not have to be defined at the time of creation of the muster instance.\n * New trees can be created as a result of resolving different [[NodeDefinition]]s. In this example\n * we have created a dynamic tree from a [[computed]].\n *\n * See the [[computed]] documentation for more information about computed nodes.\n *\n *\n * @example **Tree matchers**\n * ```js\n * import muster, { tree, match, param, ref, types } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const app = muster(tree({\n *  [match(types.string, 'treeName')]: param('treeName'),\n * }));\n *\n * const hello = await app.resolve(ref('hello'));\n * // hello === 'hello'\n *\n * const world = await app.resolve(ref('world'));\n * world === 'world'\n *\n * const stringOfNumbers = await app.resolve(ref('123'));\n * // stringOfNumbers === '123'\n *\n * const numeric = await app.resolve(ref(123));\n * // numeric === 'Invalid child name: 123'\n * ```\n * So far we've defined trees with pre-defined, static names. [[tree]] enables one more\n * way of defining trees: using a tree matcher. See [[match]] for more information on\n * matcher syntax and [[types]] about supported muster type matchers.\n *\n * In this example we've created a tree with a matcher allowing for every `string` path.\n * The content of this tree is a [[param]]. See the [[param]] documentation for more\n * information about that node.\n *\n * Below the application definition we tried to retrieve four tree names:\n * - `string 'hello'` - returned `value('hello')`\n * - `string 'world'` - returned `value('world')`\n * - `string '123'` - returned `value('123')`\n * - `number 123` - returned an error as the numeric name was not matched by this type matcher\n *\n * Note the tree matcher has two arguments:\n * - `types.string`\n * - `'treeName'`\n * The second argument defines the name of the parameter to define on the resolution context when\n * the tree name gets matched by this matcher.\n *\n * This parameter can then be used in every node belonging to that tree.\n *\n *\n * @example **Shape matchers**\n * ```js\n * import muster, { match, param, ref, tree, types, value } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const app = muster({\n *   [match(types.shape({ name: types.string }), 'obj')]: param('obj'),\n * });\n *\n * const test = await app.resolve(ref(value({ name: 'test name' })));\n * // test === { name: 'test name' }\n *\n * const testWithExtra = await app.resolve(\n *   ref(value({ name: 'test name', extra: 'extra prop' })),\n * );\n * // testWithExtra === { name: 'test name', extra: 'extra prop' }\n *\n * const notFoundNode = await app.resolve(ref(value({ extra: 'extra prop' })));\n * // notFoundNode === 'Invalid child name: {extra: \"extra prop\"})'\n * ```\n * Tree matchers need not operate only on primitive types. With the use of a [[shape]] matcher\n * we can define more complex matchers allowing more data to be squeezed into a single path entry.\n * See [[match]] documentation for more information.\n *\n *\n * @example **Using tree parameters**\n * ```js\n * import muster, { computed, match, param, ref, tree, types, value } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const app = muster({\n *   users: tree({\n *     [match(types.number, 'userId')]: computed([param('userId')], (userId) => {\n *       // Synchronously retrieve the user from some data source\n *       // or in our case - return a test tree\n *       return tree({\n *         id: value(userId),\n *         firstName: value(`User ${userId}`),\n *       });\n *     }),\n *   }),\n * });\n *\n * const userId = await app.resolve(ref('users', 1, 'id'));\n * const userFirstName = await app.resolve(ref('users', 1, 'firstName'));\n * // userId === 1\n * // userFirstName === 'User 1'\n *\n * const invalidName = await app.resolve(ref('users', 'testId', 'firstName'));\n * // invalidName === 'Invalid child key: testId'\n * ```\n * Tree matchers are a good way of creating gateways between muster and an external API.\n *\n * To handle asynchronous requests one could replace the [[computed]] with a [[fromPromise]]\n * and request the data asynchronously\n */\nexport function tree(branches) {\n    return createNodeDefinition(TreeNodeType, {\n        branches: Array.isArray(branches) ? branches : parseBranches(branches),\n    });\n}\nfunction parseBranches(branches) {\n    return [\n        // TODO: Remove the `as any` cast once https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/1863 is resolved\n        ...Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(branches).map((key) => [key, branches[key]]),\n        ...toPairs(branches),\n    ].map(([id, branch]) => {\n        if (id in MATCHERS) {\n            return Object.assign({}, MATCHERS[id], { node: branch });\n        }\n        return {\n            match: id,\n            param: undefined,\n            node: branch,\n        };\n    });\n}\nexport function isTreeNodeDefinition(value) {\n    return value.type === TreeNodeType;\n}\nexport function match(predicate, param) {\n    const matcherHash = generateMatcherKey(predicate, param);\n    MATCHERS[matcherHash] = { match: predicate, param };\n    return matcherHash;\n}\nexport function isMatcherKey(name) {\n    return name.startsWith('$$match:');\n}\nexport function hasMatcherKeyId(name) {\n    return !name.endsWith(':');\n}\nexport function getMatcherKeyId(name) {\n    const idString = name.substr(name.lastIndexOf(':') + 1);\n    return idString ?

It can be used\n * in the dependencies of a [[computed]], to link parts of the graph, as an output of a\n * [[computed]], etc.\n *\n * A path used in the ref does not have to be a string. It can be any graph node that resolves to a\n * non-dynamic node, e.g. another ref that points to a [[value]], a ref to a [[computed]]\n * that returns a [[value]], a [[value]] storing a numeric value, a [[value]] storing an object, etc.\n *\n * In most cases, a [[ref]] is defined as a path from the root of the graph. This behaviour can be\n * changed by setting the [[root]] property to a different [[NodeDefinition]]. See the \"**Overriding a root\n * node**\" example for more on this.\n *\n * Internally every [[ref]] is converted to a series of nested [[get]]s.\n * See the [[get]] documentation for more information.\n * @returns NodeDefinition\n *\n * @example **Basic ref nodes**\n * ```js\n * import muster, { ref } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const app = muster({\n *   currentUserId: 123,\n *   linkToCurrentUserId: ref('currentUserId'),\n * });\n *\n * const currentUserId = await app.resolve(ref('currentUserId'));\n * // === 123\n *\n * const linkedCurrentUserId = await app.resolve(ref('linkToCurrentUserId'));\n * // === 123\n * // currentUserId === linkedCurrentUserId\n * ```\n * In this example we have created a simple muster graph with one value node `currentUserId` and\n * another node `linkToCurrentUserId` which is a ref to a `currentUserId` node.\n *\n *\n * @example **Understanding similarities of ref and get nodes**\n * ```js\n * import muster, { get, ref, root, value } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const app = muster({\n *   language: 'en-GB',\n *   user: {\n *     firstName: 'Bob',\n *   },\n * });\n *\n * const languageByRef = await app.resolve(ref('language'));\n * // is equivalent to\n * const languageByGet = await app.resolve(get(root(), value('language')));\n *\n * const firstNameByRef = await app.resolve(ref('user', 'firstName'));\n * // is equivalent to\n * const firstNameByGet = await app.resolve(\n *   get(\n *     get(root(), value('user')),\n *     value('firstName'),\n *   ),\n * );\n * ```\n * As mentioned in the introduction, [[ref]] is nothing more than a wrapper for a [[get]].\n * This example demonstrates how [[ref]] translates into a series of [[get]]s.\n *\n * [[ref]] makes it easier to write longer queries without the need to write awkwardly nested\n * [[get]]s\n *\n *\n * @example **Overriding a root node**\n * ```js\n * import muster, { ref, root, tree, value } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const app = muster({\n *   name: 'Bob',\n * });\n *\n * const name = await app.resolve(ref('name'));\n * // name === value('Bob')\n * // or expressed as root and path:\n * const nameFromRoot = await app.resolve(ref({\n *   root: root(),\n *   path: 'name',\n * }));\n * // name === 'Bob'\n *\n * const nameFromBranch = await app.resolve(ref({\n *   root: tree({ name: value('John') }),\n *   path: 'name',\n * }));\n * // nameFromBranch === 'John'\n * ```\n * This example shows how to change a root (the starting point of the query). As you can see, the root of\n * the query can be any [[NodeDefinition]]. By default the root of the query is set to [[root]].\n * You can find out more in [[root]]'s documentation.\n *\n * The `path` property in the definition of the [[ref]] can be one of: a [[NodeLike]] object (string,\n * number, etc.), an array of [[NodeLike]] objects, or an array of [[NodeDefinition]]s\n *\n * Even though this example isn't particularly useful it can be considered a good introduction to\n * the next example: \"**Relative references**\".\n *\n *\n * @example **Relative references**\n * ```js\n * import muster, { computed, ref, relative } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const app = muster({\n *   user: {\n *     firstName: 'Bob',\n *     lastName: 'Builder',\n *     fullName: computed(\n *       [ref(relative('firstName')), ref(relative('lastName'))],\n *       (firstName, lastName) => `${firstName} ${lastName}`,\n *     ),\n *   },\n * });\n *\n * const fullName = await app.resolve(ref('user', 'fullName'));\n * // fullName === 'Bob Builder'\n * ```\n * In this example we used the [[relative]] helper function to make a reference that finds `firstName`\n * and `lastName` from the same tree as `fullName`. See the [[relative]] helper documentation for\n * more information.\n *\n *\n * @example **References to items in collections**\n * ```js\n * import muster, { first, length, last, nth, ref } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const app = muster({\n *   numbers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],\n * });\n *\n * const firstNumber = await app.resolve(ref('numbers', first()));\n * // firstNumber === 1\n *\n * const lastNumber = await app.resolve(ref('numbers', last()));\n * // lastNumber === 5\n *\n * const numbersLength = await app.resolve(ref('numbers', length()));\n * // numbersLength === 5\n *\n * const nthNumber = await app.resolve(ref('numbers', nth(2)));\n * // nthNumber === 3, because nth is 0-index-based, the same as numbers[3] in JS\n * ```\n * [[get]], and by extension [[ref]], support a handful of meta-nodes which allow\n * getting certain items out of a collection. You can see their use in this example.\n * You can find out more about collections in the collection documentation.\n *\n * All of the featured meta-nodes can be used as part of the path. Where a\n * collection contains [[tree]]s instead of [[value]]s (like in this example) we could\n * define a ref to a part of the item's tree:\n * ```js\n * const app = muster({\n *   users: [\n *     { name: 'Bob' },\n *     { name: 'Veronica' },\n *   ],\n * });\n *\n * const firstUserName = await app.resolve(ref('users', first(), 'name'));\n * // firstUserName === 'Bob'\n * ```\n *\n *\n * @example **Nested references**\n * ```js\n * import muster, {\n *   computed,\n *   match,\n *   param,\n *   ref,\n *   set,\n *   tree,\n *   types,\n *   variable,\n * } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const app = muster({\n *   currentUser: variable('bob'),\n *   users: {\n *     // This tree matcher allows for returning different user data based on the user name\n *     [match(types.string, 'userName')]: computed([param('userName')], (userName) =>\n *       tree({\n *         firstName: value(`${userName} first name`),\n *         lastName: value(`${userName} last name`),\n *       }),\n *     ),\n *   },\n * });\n *\n * // Get first name of user `bob`\n * const bobFirstName = await app.resolve(ref('users', ref('currentUser'), 'firstName'));\n * // bobFirstName === 'bob first name';\n *\n * let currentUserFirstName;\n * // Subscribe to the name of `currentUser`\n * app.resolve(ref('users', ref('currentUser'), 'firstName')).subscribe((firstName) => {\n *   currentUserFirstName = firstName;\n * });\n * // currentUserFirstName === 'bob first name'\n *\n * await app.resolve(set('currentUser', 'jane'))\n * // currentUserFirstName === 'jane first name'\n * // bobFirstName === 'bob

Note that `computeSomething`\n * does not log anything, as the content of the node is never run. This prevents the application\n * from getting into an inconsistent state.\n *\n *\n * @example **Returning a custom error**\n * ```js\n * import muster, { computed, error, ref, set, variable } from '@dws/muster';\n *\n * const app = muster({\n *   age: variable(25),\n *   spirits: computed([ref('age')], (age) => {\n *     if (age < 18) {\n *       return error('Alcohol cannot be sold to people under 18!');\n *     }\n *     return ['Beer', 'Gin', 'Whisky', 'Wine'];\n *   }),\n * });\n *\n * console.log('Subscribing to spirits');\n * app.resolve(ref('spirits')).subscribe((res) => {\n *   console.log(res);\n * });\n *\n * console.log('Changing age to 17')\n * await app.resolve(set('age', 17));\n *\n * // Console output:\n * // Subscribing to spirits\n * // ['Beer', 'Gin', 'Whisky', 'Wine']\n * // Changing age to 17\n * // new Error('Alcohol cannot be sold to people under 18!')\n * ```\n * This example shows how to report custom errors from muster.
